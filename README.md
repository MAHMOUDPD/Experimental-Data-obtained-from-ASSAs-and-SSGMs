# Experimental-Data-obtained-from-ASSAs-and-SSGMs
The above Excel file contains the experimental data obtained by solving some benchmark problems from the literature. 
This is done to test the proposed algorithms' performance compared to other recent existing algorithms.
The name of the proposed algorithms are ASSA1, ASSA2 and ASSA3. On the other hand, the compared ones are SSGM1 and SSGM2.
In the table, the metrics used in the comparison are ITER, FEVAL, MVP and CPU. These abbreviations are described as follows:

ITER    = number of iterations
FEVAL   = number of function evaluations
MVP     = number of gradient evaluations
TIME    = CPU time
VALUE_F = norm of the residual at a solution
